# Trusty Backend Challenge

First of all, **congrat's** ! You successfully past the firsts steps of our recruitement process. 

Trustyâ€™s technical test is build to help you to express yourself as a developer and give us an overview of your ability to code on an imposed stack. This exercise give you a large liberty about the logique structure and technical choices. So be free to open your mind and propose any other features that seems relevant to you. Trusteam Tech going to be really attentive to several aspects :
- your files organization,
- your code quality,
- your logique :  **the less the better**
- your technical choices,
- your open proposal : **thinking outside the box**

In this challenge, your goal is to develop an API on a node js server that retrieve organized datas from open source database.

## Guidelines

**For each level, write code that creates a new `data/output.json` file from the data in `data/input.json`.
An `expected_output.json` file is available to give you a reference on what result is expected.**

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Solve the levels in ascending order
- Only do one commit per level and include the `.git` when submiting your test

## Pointers

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the simplest thing that could work for the level you're currently solving.

The levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.
A good way to solve this is by using OOP, adding new layers of abstraction when they become necessary and possibly write tests so you don't break what you have already done.

Don't hesitate to write [shameless code](http://red-badger.com/blog/2014/08/20/i-spent-3-days-with-sandi-metz-heres-what-i-learned/) at first, and then refactor it in the next levels.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is clean, extensible and robust, so don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed, ...

Please also note that:

- All prices are stored as integers (in cents)
- Running `$ node index.js` from the level folder should generate the desired output, but of course feel free to add more files if needed.

## Sending Your Results

Once you are done, please send your results to Trusty.

You can send your Github/Gitlab/... project link or zip your directory and send it via email.
If you do not use Github/Gitlab/..., don't forget to attach your `.git` folder.

Good luck!
